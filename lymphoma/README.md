# DataSet Description

http://andrewjanowczyk.com/use-case-7-lymphoma-sub-type-classification/

> The NIA curated this dataset to address the need of identifying three sub-types of lymphoma: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Currently, class-specific probes are used in order to reliably distinguish the sub-types, but these come with additional cost and equipment overheads. Expert pathologists specializing in these types of lymphomas, on the other hand, have shown promise in being able to differentiate these sub-types on H&E, indicating that there is the potential for a DP approach to be employed. A successful approach would allow for more consistent and less demanding diagnosis of this disease. This dataset was created to mirror real-world situations and as such contains samples prepared by different pathologists at different sites. They have additionally selected samples which contain a larger degree of staining variation than one would normally expect.

> This use case represents the only classification use case of this manuscript: attempting to separate images into 1 of 3 sub-types of lymphoma. In the previous tasks, we were looking at primitives and attempting to segmented or detect them. In this case, though, a high level approach is taken, wherein we provide whole tissue samples to have the DL learn unique features of each class.
