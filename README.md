# Transfer Learning ResNet 50 for Lymphoma Sub-Typing
> Corey Chivers, PhD

This notebook is a toy example illustrating the use of pytorch to implement transfer learning from a pre-trained computer vision deep learning model to an imaging pathology task. 

The purpose is to demonstrate a very basic application of the toolset and concepts.
